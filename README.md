# Odin Project Exercise - Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

Hello everyone! This project is an exercise from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to compete by entering their names, or by playing with the defaults names Player 1 and Player 2, and taking turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game also includes win and draw conditions, with appropriate messages displayed for each outcome.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the basic structure and elements for the game interface.
- `styles/style.css`: Stylesheet for the game layout and appearance.
- `scripts/main.js`: Main logic of the game, including player management, game board rendering, and gameplay logic.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structure and layout.
- **CSS:** For styling the game board and controls.
- **JavaScript:** For game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features

- **Two players gameplay:** Players can enter their names and are assigned the marks X and O.
- **Game board:** A 3x3 grid that updates based on player moves.
- **Win and draw detection:** The game checks for winning combinations and draw conditions after each move.
- **Reset functionality:** Players can reset the game and play again.
- **Interactive user interface:** The game board and control buttons are dynamically rendered and updated.
